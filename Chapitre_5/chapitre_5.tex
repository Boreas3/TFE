\quad\, In the introduction, the simplest configuration for the Brayton gas cycle have been defined has being a cycle successively composed of a compressor, a combustion chamber and a turbine. This simple configuration is called Gas Turbine or GT. 

The previous chapter \ref{C4} described individually these components by providing the required theoretical notions to be able to analyze their performances. Now, the components will be considered together as a thermodynamic cycle to assess the performances of the Gas Turbine and of its existing variants.

\quad\, The Gas Turbine (GT) is the most basic configuration of the Brayton cycle. As it is illustrated in the Figure \ref{fig:C5_BraytonGT}, the three main component are the the compressor (COMP), the combustion chamber (CC) and the turbine (TURB).

\end{figure}

The compressor and the turbine are both installed on the same shaft. Since there aren't any gearbox, the rotational speed of both component are the same. The generator (G) is also attached to the shaft to convert the generated mechanical power into electricity. 
When the machine starts, the generator becomes a motor to provide the required energy to help the turbine. Indeed, at low rotational speed the power consumed by the compressor is usually greater than the power produced by the turbine alone. 



As it is illustrated in the Figure \ref{fig:C5_BraytonGT}, the cycle can be decomposed into 8 thermodynamic states. For each connection between two elements, there are piping that will induce some pressure drops. For each of these states the temperature and pressure are measure in order to fully characterized the state. The Table \ref{tab:C5_thermo_state_GT} includes the different states emphasized on Figure \ref{fig:C5_BraytonGT}.

Where the state \textbf{0} corresponds to the reference conditions. It is worth to note that for the compressor and the turbine, the stagnation quantities are used. The reason is that in this work, method to compute the Mach number haven't been considered. This is the reason why the pressure ratios and the isentropic efficiencies that will be considered for the compressor and the turbine are based on total quantities.

For each of the mentioned states, 5 thermodynamic properties are evaluated. Namely the temperature, pressure, enthalpy, entropy and density. For the last variable, the ideal gas equation (\ref{eq:C2_GP}) from the chapter \ref{C2} is used. 

A graphical representation of these states can be performed by drawing some thermodynamic diagrams. Here, the T-s and p-v diagrams have been drawn in the Figures \ref{fig:C5_Ts_GT} and \ref{fig:C5_pv_GT} respectively. The diagrams have been obtained using the computer code that will be described in the next chapters. For now, let's just assume that the program is just a black box.

        \label{fig:C5_thermo_diagram_GT}
\end{figure}

These two diagrams have been obtained considering ideal components. An ideal components is characterized by an efficiency of 100\%. This means that the there aren't any pressure drops, the isentropic efficiency $\eta_{is}$ of the compressor and the turbine is equal to 100\%, and the combustion chamber efficiency $\eta_{cc}$ is also equal to 100\%.

The p-v diagram gives an indication of the net work produced by the GT cycle. Indeed, it has been seen that the work is given by the integral (\ref{eq:C5_W}).

\begin{equation}
    \setstretch{1}
    W_{net} = \oint_{cycle}pdv\label{eq:C5_W}
\end{equation}
where $p$ is the pressure and $v$ the specific volume of the fluid.

The first diagram shows the effect of the isentropic efficiency regarding to the evolution of the entropy during the compression and the expansion. Here, since the isentropic efficiency have been set to 100\%, the entropy at the beginning and the end of the these transformations are equal.

Also, it can be noticed that at the exhaust of the cycle, the energy available within the gas is still non negligible. A possible way of improvement will be given in the following section.

The thermal efficiency of the cycle can be computed based on the knowledge of the different states \textbf{1} to \textbf{8}. By definition, the thermal efficiency $\eta_{th}$ corresponds to the ratio (\ref{eq:C5_etath}) between the net power output $\dot{W}_{net}$ and the heat transfer rate from coming from the injected fuel.

\begin{equation}
    \setstretch{1}
    \eta_{th} = \frac{\dot{W}_{net}}{\dot{m}_{fuel}\cdot HCV_{fuel}} \label{eq:C5_etath}
\end{equation}
Where $HCV_{fuel}$ is the low heat calorific value (J/kg) of the fuel.

Based on this definition, the efficiency of the Gas Turbine cycle is $\eta_{th,GT} =24$\%. This efficiency is obtained for an ideal cycle composed of ideal components. Therefore, this represents a upper bound for any real GT cycle playing with the same level of temperature and pressure.

\section{Regenerative Gas Turbine (RGT)}

\quad\, As seen in the previous section, the gas cycle does not have a really high efficiency. This is due to the huge amount of energy available in the exhaust gas that are wasted. However, this high level energy could be used to preheat the air before entering the combustion chamber. 

This is done by using a heat exchanger called regenerator. By adding a regenerator, the amount of energy to be provided to the combustion chamber to reach the same target temperature will be smaller since the inlet temperature of the air will be higher.

This variant of the Gas Turbine cycle is called Regenerative Gas Turbine (RGT) cycle. A schematic of this cycle is given in the Figure \ref{fig:C5_RGT}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{RGT}
\caption{Regenerative Gas Turbine (RGT)}
\label{fig:C5_RGT}
\end{figure}

Similarly to the GT cycle, to maximum thermal efficiency $\eta_{is,RGT}$ of the cycle is achieved by considering all the components as ideal. In addition to the turbomachines and the combustion chamber, the efficiency of the heat-exchanger will be set at 100\%. 

The states from \textbf{1} to \textbf{12} can be represented using T-s and p-v diagrams. The two diagrams are included in the set of Figures \ref{fig:C5_thermo_diagram_RGT}.

\begin{figure}[h]
     \centering

        \label{fig:C5_thermo_diagram_RGT}
\end{figure}

As shown in the T-s diagram, there is as expected a heat transfer from the hot gas to the cold air. This heat transfer allows using the available energy from the hot gas to heat-up the air from the compressor. Thanks to this heat transfer, the combustion chamber only needs to raise the temperature of the air from 630\degree C to around 900\degree C. 

The reduction of the difference of temperatures between the inlet and the outlet of the combustion chamber allows to reduce a lot the consumption of fuel. For the same mass flow rate of air of 180 g/s, the excess of air increased from 2 to 7.   

Thanks to the regenerator, the thermal efficiency of the cycle is really improved. Indeed, from 24\% for the ideal GT cycle, the efficiency of the Regenerative Gas Turbine cycle is now 65\%.



Aside the regerator, a water heat exchanger (WHX) can be used to absorb the remaining from the exhaust gas to utilize it for water heating. Considering the fact that components does not have an efficiency of 100\%, the temperature at the outlet of the regenerator (state \textbf{11}) is around 200\degree C. This temperature is enough to heat up water to a target temperature of 70-80\degree C.

Even if it is beyond the scope of this master thesis, the integration of an organic rankine cycle (ORC) in place of the WHX to convert the remaining heat into electricity can also be considered\citep{Quoilin2008}.

The GT and RGT are not the only configurations of the Brayton cycle. There exists many other involving multiple compressors, turbines, combustion chamber,etc... These configurations are illustrated in the annex \ref{annex:Brayton_variant}.

It exists many variants many variants of the Brayton cycle because engineers wanted to cover a large numbers of applications. For instance, when a large compression ratio is desired, using only one compressor is not possible. Therefore, it is necessary to split the compression between a low pressure and a high compressor.
