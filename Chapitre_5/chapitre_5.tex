\quad\, In the introduction, the simplest configuration for the Brayton gas cycle has been defined as being a cycle successively composed of a compressor, a combustion chamber and a turbine. This simple configuration is called Gas Turbine or GT. 

The previous chapter \ref{C4} described individually these components by providing the required theoretical notions to be able to analyze their performances. Now, the components will be considered together as a thermodynamic cycle to assess the performances of the Gas Turbine and of its existing variants.

\quad\, The Gas Turbine (GT) is the most basic configuration of the Brayton cycle. As it is illustrated in the Figure \ref{fig:C5_BraytonGT}, the three main components are the compressor (COMP), the combustion chamber (CC) and the turbine (TURB).

\begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig:C5_BraytonGT}
\end{figure}

The compressor and the turbine are both installed on the same shaft. Since there aren't any gearbox, the rotational speed of both turbomachines are the same. The generator (G) is also attached to the shaft to convert the generated mechanical power into electricity. 
When the machine starts, the generator becomes a motor to provide the required energy to help the turbine. Indeed, at low rotational speed the power consumed by the compressor is usually greater than the power produced by the turbine alone. 



As it is illustrated in the Figure \ref{fig:C5_BraytonGT}, the cycle can be decomposed into 8 thermodynamic states. For each connection between two elements, there are piping that will induce some pressure drops. For each of these states, the temperature and pressure are measured in order to fully characterized the state. The Table \ref{tab:C5_thermo_state_GT} includes the different states emphasized on Figure \ref{fig:C5_BraytonGT}.

Where the state \textbf{0} corresponds to the reference conditions. It is worth noting that for the compressor and the turbine, the stagnation quantities are used. The reason is that in this work, method to compute the Mach number hasn't been considered. This is the reason why the pressure ratios and the isentropic efficiency that will be considered for the compressor and the turbine are based on total quantities.

For each of the mentioned states, 5 thermodynamic properties are evaluated. Namely the temperature, pressure, enthalpy, entropy and density. For the last variable, the ideal gas equation (\ref{eq:C2_GP}) from the chapter \ref{C2} is used. 

A graphical representation of these states can be performed by drawing some thermodynamic diagrams. Here, the p-v and T-s diagrams have been drawn in the Figures \ref{fig:C5_pv_GT} and \ref{fig:C5_Ts_GT} respectively. 

The choice of the T-s diagram instead of the h-s diagram is motivated by the fact that temperatures are quantities that have an easier interpretation. Since only ideal gases are considered, the enthalpy variation is equivalent to the temperature variation multiplied by the heat capacity at constant pressure.

The diagrams have been obtained using the computer code that will be described in the next chapters. For now, let's just assume that the program is just a black box.

\begin{figure}[H]
     \centering
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pv_GT}
         \caption{p-v diagram}
         \label{fig:C5_pv_GT}
     \end{subfigure}
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Ts_GT}

     \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Thermodynamic diagrams - Gas Turbine}
        \label{fig:C5_thermo_diagram_GT}
\end{figure}

These two diagrams have been obtained considering ideal components. An ideal component is characterized by an efficiency of 100\%. This means that there aren't any pressure drops, the isentropic efficiency $\eta_{is}$ of the compressor and the turbine is equal to 100\%, and the combustion chamber efficiency $\eta_{cc}$ is also equal to 100\%.

As it can be noticed, the graphs are open. Indeed, the exhaust gas from the outlet of the turbine is returned to the environment with all its energy. The transformation from the state \textbf{8} to the state \textbf{1} would corresponds to the return at the ambient conditions of the exhaust gas. 

The net work provided by the Brayton cycle corresponds to the area inscribed in the loop \textbf{1}$\rightarrow$\textbf{8}$\rightarrow$\textbf{1}. Mathematically, it is obtained by computing one of the two integrals (\ref{eq:C5_W}) and (\ref{eq:C5_Ws}). These two integrals are respectively associated to the p-v and T-s diagrams.

\begin{subequations}  
\setstretch{1}
\begin{align}
    W_{net} = \oint_{cycle}pdv\label{eq:C5_W}\\
    W_{net} = \oint_{cycle}Tds\label{eq:C5_Ws}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Now considering the first diagram, it shows the effect of the isentropic efficiency regarding to the evolution of the entropy during the compression and the expansion. Here, since the isentropic efficiency have been set to 100\%, the entropy at the beginning and the end of these transformations are equal. If real components were considered, the entropy would increase during the compression and the expansion.

Also, it can be noticed that at the exhaust of the cycle, the thermal energy available within the gas is still non-negligible. This energy at high temperature has a great potential and could be utilized to improve the cycle. A possible way of improvement will be given in the following section.

The thermal efficiency of the cycle can be computed based on the knowledge of the different states \textbf{1} to \textbf{8}. By definition, the thermal efficiency $\eta_{th}$ corresponds to the ratio (\ref{eq:C5_etath}) between the net power output $\dot{W}_{net}$ and the heat transfer rate from coming from the injected fuel.

\begin{equation}
    \setstretch{1}
    \eta_{th} = \frac{\dot{W}_{net}}{\dot{m}_{fuel}\cdot HCV_{fuel}} \label{eq:C5_etath}
\end{equation}
Where $HCV_{fuel}$ is the low heat calorific value (J/kg) of the fuel.

Based on this definition, the efficiency of the Gas Turbine cycle is $\eta_{th,GT} =24$\%. This efficiency is obtained for an ideal cycle composed of ideal components. The associated net power output is equal to 42.05 kW. 

The computed efficiency represents an upper bound for any real GT cycle playing with the same level of temperature and pressure.

\section{Regenerative Gas Turbine}

\quad\, As seen in the previous section, the gas cycle does not have a really high efficiency. This is due to the huge amount of energy available in the exhaust gas that is wasted. However, this high-level energy could be used to preheat the air before entering the combustion chamber. 

This is done by using a heat exchanger called regenerator. By adding a regenerator, the amount of energy to be provided to the combustion chamber to reach the same target temperature will be smaller since the inlet temperature of the air will be higher.

This variant of the Gas Turbine cycle is called Regenerative Gas Turbine (RGT) cycle. A schematic of this cycle is given in the Figure \ref{fig:C5_RGT}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{RGT}
\caption{Regenerative GT (RGT)}
\label{fig:C5_RGT}
\end{figure}

Similarly to the GT cycle, to maximum thermal efficiency $\eta_{is,RGT}$ of the cycle is achieved by considering all the components as ideal. In addition to the turbomachines and the combustion chamber, the efficiency of the heat exchanger will be set at 100\%. 

The states from \textbf{1} to \textbf{12} can be represented using T-s and p-v diagrams. The two diagrams are included in the set of Figures \ref{fig:C5_thermo_diagram_RGT}.

\begin{figure}[h]
     \centering
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Ts_RGT}
         \caption{T-s diagram}
         \label{fig:C5_Ts_RGT}
     \end{subfigure}
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pv_RGT}

         \label{fig:C5_pv_RGT}
     \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Thermodynamic diagrams - Regenerative Gas Turbine}
        \label{fig:C5_thermo_diagram_RGT}
\end{figure}

As shown in the T-s diagram, there is as expected a heat transfer from the hot gas to the cold air. This heat transfer allows using the available energy from the hot gas to heat-up the air from the compressor. Thanks to this heat transfer, the combustion chamber only needs to raise the temperature of the air from 630\degree C to 920\degree C. 

The reduction of the difference of temperatures between the inlet and the outlet of the combustion chamber allows reducing a lot the consumption of fuel. For the same mass flow rate of air, the excess of air increased from 2 to 7.   

Thanks to the regenerator, the thermal efficiency of the cycle is really improved. Indeed, from 24\% for the ideal GT cycle, the efficiency of the Regenerative Gas Turbine cycle is now 65\%. The net power output is here equal to 41.35 kW.

The addition of the regenerator is only interesting when the pressure ratio involved is relatively small. Indeed, it can be demonstrated that the thermal efficiency of the RGT cycle varies as the inverse of the pressure ratio. On the other hand, the efficiency of the Gas Turbine cycle without regenerator increases with the pressure ratio. 

The Figure \ref{fig:C5_eff_RGT-GT} shows that, for a pressure ratio beyond 12.5, the cycle with regenerator has a thermal efficiency lower than the cycle without regenerator.

\end{figure}

\section{Intercooler-Regenerative-Reheat GT}
\quad\ The two cycles described previously are characterized by the usage of one compressor and one turbine. However, it happens that for some applications, the pressure ratio between the high and the ambient pressures is too large to be handled by one stage of turbomachines.

A type of Gas Turbine that is often considered to response to this problem is the Intercooler-Regenerative-Reheat Gas Turbine (IRHGT). For the IRHGT, the compression and the expansion are split between a low pressure (LP) and high pressure (HP) compressor and turbine (respectively). The low-pressure and high-pressure compressors and turbines are usually on the two different shafts due to the difference of rotational speed.  

Between the two compression stages, a water heat exchanger called intercooler is installed to cool down the compressed air from the LP compressor before going into the HP compressor. This water heat exchanger is called intercooler. The addition of an intercooler will allow to increase the \textbf{density} of the compressed thanks to the cooling. Indeed, when the air is compressed, its temperature is increased. However, at the same pressure, a hot gas will have a smaller density than cold gas. 

The opposite reasoning stands for the two stages of expansion. After the first stage, the expanded gas enters a second combustion chamber to be reheated. The reheat is performed to increase the \textbf{specific volume} of the gas before entering the low-pressure turbine. 

The IRHGT cycle is depicted in the Figure \ref{fig:C5_IRHGT}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{IRHGT}
\caption{Intercooler-Regenerative-Reheat GT (IRHGT)}
\label{fig:C5_IRHGT}
\end{figure}

The T-s and p-v diagrams have been drawn for the case of an ideal IRHGT cycle. The two diagrams are in the Figures \ref{fig:C5_Ts_IRHGT} and \ref{fig:C5_pv_IRHGT}.

\begin{figure}[h]
     \centering
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Ts_IRHGT}
         \caption{T-s diagram}
         \label{fig:C5_Ts_IRHGT}
     \end{subfigure}
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pv_IRHGT}
         \caption{p-v diagram}

     \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Thermodynamic diagrams - Intercooler-Regenerative-Reheat Gas Turbine}
        \label{fig:C5_thermo_diagram_IRHGT}
\end{figure}

For this particular IRHGT cycle, the compressed air from the LP compressor is cooled down to 50\degree C and the gas at the inlet of the two turbines is at 920\degree C. Considering these temperatures, the thermal efficiency of the ideal IRHGT is equal 65\%. The associated net power output of 68 kW. It can be noticed that the efficiency of the cycle is identical to the one of the RGT cycle. However, the net power produced by this enhanced cycle is 26 kW higher.

\quad\ Aside the Gas Turbine, two variants have been described in the previous section. However, there exists many other configurations that can be studied. There exists Brayton gas cycle where only the compression is staged, or cycle where the expansion is performed before the combustion. This variant is called Externally-Fired Gas Turbine (EFGT) and reduces the stress on the turbine induced by the fumes.

Also, once the fumes are at the exit of the cycle, it remains low quality heat (below 200\degree C except for the GT cycle) that can be used to heat-up water for sanitary usage.

The Table \ref{tab:C5_inputconfig} gives a non-exhaustive list of existing variant of the gas cycles. Schematics of each cycle can be found in the  annex \ref{annex:Brayton_variant}.
