\chapter{Thermodynamic components}
\quad\, In the beginning of the previous chapter, it has been mention that the Brayton cycle composed of several components that are more or less complex. The behavior of these components, which is required to realized the study the global system, is based on the thermodynamic notions that have be introduce all along the past lines.

This chapter will be focused on the description of those components. For each of them, it will be provided the concepts or principles that will be used during this work.

 %The following subsection will provide qualitative information about heat exchangers. The different families of HX based on the stream configurations or the geometries will be defined.

%\subsection{Families of heat exchangers}
%\quad\, Before studying the performances of any heat exchangers, it is interesting to establish a short state of the art. As it has been previously mentioned, among the heat exchangers can be distinguished the recuperators and the regenerators. However, these categories is based on the type of applications.
%
%\subsubsection{Families based on stream configurations}
%First, a categorization can be made based on the flow configurations within the heat exchanger. From this analysis, four can be created.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\setstretch{1}
%\item Parallel flow HX: The two streams go through the heat exchanger in the same direction.

%\newpage
%\item Counter flow HX: The two streams go through the heat exchanger in the opposite direction. This configuration is more frequent than the parallel flow HX due to higher efficiency.

%\end{figure}

%\item Cross flow HX, both fluids unmixed:  This configuration, illustrated on Figure \ref{fig:C3_cross_flow_unmixed}. The flow in the tube does not sees the property of cross flow varying along with the distance traveled. Both flow are unmixed.

%\end{figure}
%\item Cross flow HX, one fluid mixed:  This configuration, illustrated on Figure \ref{fig:C3_cross_flow_1mixed}. The flow in the tube does not sees the property of cross flow varying along with the distance traveled. The cross flow does not travel inside isolated channels.
