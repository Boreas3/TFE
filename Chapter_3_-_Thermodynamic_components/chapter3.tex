\chapter{Thermodynamic components}\label{C3}
\quad\, In the beginning of the previous chapter, it has been mention that the Brayton cycle composed of several components that are more or less complex. The behavior of these components, which is required to realized the study the global system, is based on the thermodynamic notions that have be introduce all along the past lines.

This chapter will be focused on the description of those components. For each of them, it will be provided the concepts or principles that will be used during this work. Then, a description of the Brayton cycle itself will be provided. Different configurations will be proposed and compared.
