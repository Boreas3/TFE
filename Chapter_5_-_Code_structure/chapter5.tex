\chapter{Code structure}
\quad\, In the chapter \ref{Brayton cycle}, the Brayton cycle has been introduced by presenting two configurations. Also, it has been mentioned that many other configurations (illustrated in the annex \ref{annex:Brayton_variant}) exists to cover a large panel of applications. 

This chapter will be devoted to the description of the  Brayton cycle model. This model, which will considered steady state operations, will not take into account transient effects like acceleration of the turbomachines, heating up of the heat-exchangers,etc...

The computer code that will be presented is based on the Python language\citep{van1995python}. The motivations of the usage of this particular computing language, will be given in the beginning of this chapter. Then, the structure of the model itself will be established, followed by the explanation of the implementation of the theoretical aspects saw in chapter \ref{C3}.

\section{Flow chart of the model}
\quad\, the previous section shows that Python was a great language due to its huge community and the ability to do oriented object programming. Combined with the fact that Python is free and open source, it has been chosen to program the model developed during this master thesis under the Python language.

Now that the choice of the the programming language have been motivated, the structure of the model has to be established.
