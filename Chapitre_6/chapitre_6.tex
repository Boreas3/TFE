\chapter{Brayton cycle modeling}\label{C6}
\quad\, This chapter is about the description of the different part constituting the Brayton cycle model. The previous chapter described the main structure of the program. Also, it showed that the model is designed in such manner that the objects representing the different components of the cycle are consecutively called. 

Two categories, namely the static and non-static objects, have been defined to distinguish the fluids to the thermodynamic components. Indeed, the non-static objects are constructed to be used within the static objects.
