\chapter{Notions of the thermodynamics}\label{C2}
\quad\, In the introduction, it has been introduced many times the concept and the used of the Brayton cycle. As explained, this concept has been applied for many usages, including electricity production and aircraft propulsion which are the most common and known applications. It has been exposed that from the invention proposed by George Brayton in the end of the 19th century, the technology did really evolve.

Indeed, while the Brayton cycle engine first appears as a  piston engine where the compression, combustion and expansion occurs in the same enclosure, Nowadays 
the process is shared between at least three components (namely the compressor, the turbine and the combustion chamber).

However, the keys notions to understand how theses components behave have not been introduced yet. This problematic will be covered by this chapter, which will introduce step-by-step those notions.

 %To summarize what have been done in this chapter, it has first been introduced the concept of open and closed system. Then, the notion of state variables has been defined. It has been exposed that these variables allows to assess the state of any closed or open system.
%
%Then, based on the two principles of the thermodynamic, it has been defined the notions of energy, enthalpy, specific heat and entropy. Those really valuable tools offer the means to fully determined the state of any systems. The energy conservation efficiency has been defined, providing a method to establish the quality of a transformation.
%
%The next chapter will be focused on the description of the different components constituting the Brayton cycle. The notions that have already been discussed in those lines will be supposed to be integrated by the reader. Therefore, those will not be repeated.
